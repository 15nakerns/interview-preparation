####[[↑]](#toc) <a name='technical'>Technical Questions:</a>

1. **Design a class to hold data about something medical related, like an allergy or medicine.**

* **What is the difference between a class and object?**  

	| Class | Object |
	|:-----:|:------:|
	| A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. | An object is an instance of a class. |
	| Classes do not have a lifespan | Objects have a lifespan |

* **If you had to determine whether a padlock was functioning properly with only 3 tests, what tests would you use?**

* **Create a class that has info about some disease, can be updated easily, how would you record the time of the disease report.**

* **Create an object that tells a nurse the frequency of medicine that a patient must take.**

* **Make an object that holds temperatures of a person and can say whether or not they have a fever.**

* **How would you go about debugging your code if a client brought up issues with the program.**

* **How do you handle garbage collecting?**

* **Couple of questions regarding ACID properties using a real time scenario.**

* **How would you debug on a real-time parallel processing system?**

* **Design a class to schedule medicine delivery.**

* **Sudoku algorithm.**

* **Can you explain what garbage collector is?**  
Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to solve problems in Lisp.

* **How you would create a program for a simple game, like chess or checkers in an OOL.**

* **Write a program to find max number read input from user and return max number.**

* **Print Foo if number is divisible by 5 and bar if number is divisible by 7 and foobar if number is divisible by 5 & 7.**  
FooBar

* **Find a number using binary search algorithm.**

* **What are memory managed languages, name them.**

* **What are the responsibilities of a programmer in a memory managed language.**

* **Difference between memory managed and non-memory managed languages.**

* **How do you approach a bug?**

* **Difference between unit testing and integration testing?**
	* **Unit Testing**  
		A unit test is a test written by the programmer to verify that a relatively small piece of code is doing what it is intended to do. They are narrow in scope, they should be easy to write and execute, and their effectiveness depends on what the programmer considers to be useful. The tests are intended for the use of the programmer, they are not directly useful to anybody else, though, if they do their job, testers and users downstream should benefit from seeing fewer bugs.
	* **Integration Testing**  
		An integration test is done to demonstrate that different pieces of the system work together. Integration tests cover whole applications, and they require much more effort to put together. They usually require resources like database instances and hardware to be allocated for them. The integration tests do a more convincing job of demonstrating the system works (especially to non-programmers) than a set of unit tests can, at least to the extent the integration test environment resembles production.

* **Different types of testing.**
	* **Black box testing** - Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality.
	* **White box testing** - This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application's code.
	* **Unit testing** - Testing of individual software components or modules.
	* **Integration testing** - Testing of integrated modules to verify combined functionality after integration.
	* **Incremental integration testing** - Bottom up approach for testing i.e continuous testing of an application as new functionality is added.
	* **Functional testing** - This type of testing ignores the internal parts and focus on the output is as per requirement or not. Black box type testing geared to functional requirements of an application.
	* **System testing** - Entire system is tested as per the requirements. Black box type testing that is based on overall requirements specifications, covers all combined parts of a system.
	* **End to end testing** - Similar to system testing, involves testing of a complete application environment in a situation that mimics real-world use, such as interacting with a database, using network communications, or interacting with other hardware, applications, or systems if appropriate.
	* **Sanity testing** - Testing to determine if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort. If application is crasching for initial use then system is not stable enough for further testing and build or aplication is assigned to fix.
	* **Regression testing** - Testing the application as a whole for the modification in any module or functionality.
	* **Acceptance testing** - Testing done by user or customers to verify if systems meet the customer specified requirements.
	* **Load testing** - It's a performance testing to check system behavior under load. Testing an application under heavy loads, such as testing of a web site under a range of loads to determine at what point the system’s response time degrades or fails.
	* **Stress testing** - System is stressed beyond its specifications to check how and when it fails. Performed under heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity, complex database queries, continuous input to system or database load.
	* **Performance testing** - To check whether system meets performance requirements. Used different performance and load tools to do this.
	* **Usability testing** - User-friendliness check. Application flow is tested, Can new user understand the application easily, Proper help documented whenever user stuck at any point. Basically system navigation is checked in this testing.

* **Joins in database.**
	* Inner Join - intersection of A and B
	* Left Join - A and intersection of A and B
	* Right Join - B and intersection of A and B
	* Full Outer Join - A union B

* **Difference between array and linked list.**

	| Array | Linked List |
	|:-----:|:-----------:|
	| Size is fixed | Dynamic size |
	| Inserting new element is expensive | Ease of insertion / deletion |
	| Random access is allowed | Random access is not allowed |
	| Better cache locality which affects performance | Extra memory space for a pointer for each element of the list |

* **Complexity of binary search when array is not sorted.**  
Binary search is for sorted list. It does not work for unsorted list. For unsorted list, just do a straight search starting from the first element O(n). If not, use O(nlogn) sort then do binary search.

* **Unit Testing, Database Normalization, Binary Trees, Relational Databases, Time Complexity of Linked Lists.**

* **What is Code Coverage?**  
Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage.

	Basic Coverage Criteria
	* **Function coverage** - has each function in the program been called?
	* **Statement coverage** - has each statement in the program been executed?
	* **Branch coverage** - has each branch of each control structure been executed?
	* **Condition coverage** - has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?

* **Unit test a function which uses the following parameters: reverseString(originalString, stringToBeReversed, stringReverseTo, max) (Come up with as many test cases as possible).**

* **Design a chess game using OOP concepts.**

* **What are pointers, how are they used, what is a wild pointer.**

* **What is buffer overflow.**  
A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold.

* **What is first chance exception.**  
When an application is being debugged, the debugger gets notified whenever an exception is encountered. At this point, the application is suspended and the debugger decides how to handle the exception. The first pass through this mechanism is called a first chance exception. Depending on the debugger's configuration, it will either resume the application and pass the exception on or it will leave the application suspended and enter debug mode. If the application handles the exception, it continues to run normally.

* **Design an unbalanced BST using the word "CERNER", duplicates allowed.**

* **What is the difference between inheritance and encapsulation.**

* **What is normalization and denormalization in database.**

* **What is RDBMS?**  
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of one or more database table fields.

* **How will you design an employee database in a company.**

* **Tell me something that you really like about Java and something that you really dislike.**

* **Recursive VS Iterative algorithm.**

* **If a user reports a bug in the application, what steps would you take?**

* **DBMS VS RDBMS.**

* **Complexity of search algorithm in Linked List.**  
O(n)

* **Concept of 1 to many relationships in databases with an example.**

* **Code for finding an output of a recursive program.**

* **Name and explain the various design patterns.**

* **There is a class Car and a class Paint. What is the relationship between them and explain.**

* **What is database normalization and forms of it.**

* **Various software testing levels and explain.**

* **Deadlock, explain.**  
Deadlock is a situation when two threads are waiting on each other to release a resource. Each thread waiting for a resource which is held by the other waiting thread.

* **Complexity of linked list and tree insertion.**  
LinkedList - O(1)  
Tree - O(log(n))

* **What is path coverage?**

* **What is relative database?**

* **What are scopes in programming languages and their uses?**

* **Program that determines whether or not a number is prime?**  
IsPrime

* **If there was anything you wanted to change about a programming language, what would it be?**

* **Explain a time when you used polymorphism.**

* **Which was my favorite IDE, debugging tool.**

* **Explain buble sort, insertion sort, merge sort.**  
	* **Bubble Sort**  
	Is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  
	* **Insertion Sort**  
	Is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
	* **Merge Sort**  
	Is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element and then repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

* **Construct a binary search tree from given set of nodes.**

* **Explain insertion/deletion and traversal in BST.**

* **Design a car parking lot.**
ParkingLot

* **Showed me a method signature for a method that would search and replace text in a string. If you were writing unit tests what would you test for?**

* **Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList**

	| ArrayList | LinkedList |
	|:---------:|:----------:|
	| Uses dynamic array | Uses doubly linked list |
	| Is not efficient for manipulation because of shifting | Efficient for manipulation |
	| Better to store and fetch data | Better to manipulate data |

* **How to create unit test cases?**

* **Design a traffic signal using Java.**  
TrafficSignal

* **What is the difference between a Set and a List?**

	| Set | List |
	|:---:|:----:|
	| Does not allow duplicates | Allow duplicates |
	| Unordered collection | Ordered collection |
	| HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet | ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList |
	| Use when want unique elements | Use when want to maintain the order |

* **Describe the most difficult software bug you ever encountered in software you were developing, how you approached it, and how you resolved it.**

* **Describe tree and heap data structures.**

* **What is MVC?**  
Model View Controller (MVC) is a design pattern for successfully and efficiently relating the user interface to underlying data models.
	* **Model** - Represents the underlying, logical structure of data in a software application and the high level class associated with it. This object model does not contain any information about the user interface.
	* **View** - Collection of classes representing the elements in the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes, and so forth).
	* **Controller** - The class connecting the model and the view, and is used to communicate between classes in the model and view.

* **When and why to use recursion.**
	* Iterative functions are typically faster than their recursive counterparts. So, if speed is an issue, you would normally use iteration.
	* If the stack limit is too constraining then you will prefer iteration over recursion.
	* Some procedures are very naturally programmed recursively, and all but unmanageable iteratively.

* **Name and describe java design patterns.**

* **Describe generics.**  
Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify with a single method declaration, a set of related methods or, with a single class declaration, a set of related types respectively.

* **Inner join VS outer join.**

	| Inner Join | Outer Join |
	|:----------:|:----------:|
	| Inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B; the inner part of a venn diagram | Outer join of A and B gives the result of A union B; the outer part of a venn diagram |

* **Software life cycle and software testing.**

* **Explain a time when you used inheritance.**

* **Program to convert number to binary.**  
NumberToBinary

* **How was MVVM design pattern used in my project.**

* **Can interfaces be instantiated?**  
No. You can only implement an interface.

* **Abstract vs Interface**

	| Abstract | Interface |
	|:--------:|:---------:|
	| Contains at least one abstract method. | Can only contain only abstract methods. |
	| Can have `public`, `private`, `protected` or default variables and also constants. | Variable is by default `public final`. |
	| A class can extend only 1 abstract class | A class can implement multiple interfaces. |
	| Not compulsory to implement all methods when extended. | Compulsory to implement all methods when implemented. |
	| Can simply implement a new method. | If new implementation is added, all classes need to implement the interface. |

* **Private, protected, public.**

	| Modifier | Accessible in the same package | Accessible in different package |
	|:------------:|:-----:|:----------------------------:|
	|	Private		|	No	|	No	|
	|	Protected	|	Yes	|	Yes, only if the class extends the main class  |
	|	Default		|	Yes	|	No	|
	|	Public		|	Yes	|	Yes	|
