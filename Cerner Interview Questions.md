####[[↑]](#toc) <a name='technical'>Technical Questions:</a>

1. **What is the difference between a class and object?**  

	| Class | Object |
	|:-----:|:------:|
	| A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. | An object is an instance of a class. |
	| Classes do not have a lifespan | Objects have a lifespan |

* **Can you explain what garbage collector is?**  
Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.

* **Print Foo if number is divisible by 5 and bar if number is divisible by 7 and foobar if number is divisible by 5 & 7.**  
FooBar

* **Difference between unit testing and integration testing?**
	* **Unit Testing**  
		A unit test is a test written by the programmer to verify that a relatively small piece of code is doing what it is intended to do. They are narrow in scope, they should be easy to write and execute, and their effectiveness depends on what the programmer considers to be useful. The tests are intended for the use of the programmer, they are not directly useful to anybody else, though, if they do their job, testers and users downstream should benefit from seeing fewer bugs.
	* **Integration Testing**  
		An integration test is done to demonstrate that different pieces of the system work together. Integration tests cover whole applications, and they require much more effort to put together. They usually require resources like database instances and hardware to be allocated for them. The integration tests do a more convincing job of demonstrating the system works (especially to non-programmers) than a set of unit tests can, at least to the extent the integration test environment resembles production.

* **Different types of testing and explain.**
	* **Black box testing** - Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality.
	* **White box testing** - This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application's code.
	* **Unit testing** - Testing of individual software components or modules.
	* **Integration testing** - Testing of integrated modules to verify combined functionality after integration.
	* **Incremental integration testing** - Bottom up approach for testing i.e continuous testing of an application as new functionality is added.
	* **Functional testing** - This type of testing ignores the internal parts and focus on the output is as per requirement or not. Black box type testing geared to functional requirements of an application.
	* **System testing** - Entire system is tested as per the requirements. Black box type testing that is based on overall requirements specifications, covers all combined parts of a system.
	* **End to end testing** - Similar to system testing, involves testing of a complete application environment in a situation that mimics real-world use, such as interacting with a database, using network communications, or interacting with other hardware, applications, or systems if appropriate.
	* **Sanity testing** - Testing to determine if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort. If application is crasching for initial use then system is not stable enough for further testing and build or aplication is assigned to fix.
	* **Regression testing** - Testing the application as a whole for the modification in any module or functionality.
	* **Acceptance testing** - Testing done by user or customers to verify if systems meet the customer specified requirements.
	* **Load testing** - It's a performance testing to check system behavior under load. Testing an application under heavy loads, such as testing of a web site under a range of loads to determine at what point the system’s response time degrades or fails.
	* **Stress testing** - System is stressed beyond its specifications to check how and when it fails. Performed under heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity, complex database queries, continuous input to system or database load.
	* **Performance testing** - To check whether system meets performance requirements. Used different performance and load tools to do this.
	* **Usability testing** - User-friendliness check. Application flow is tested, Can new user understand the application easily, Proper help documented whenever user stuck at any point. Basically system navigation is checked in this testing.

* **Joins in database.**
	* Inner Join - intersection of A and B
	* Left Join - A and intersection of A and B
	* Right Join - B and intersection of A and B
	* Full Outer Join - A union B

* **Difference between array and linked list.**

	| Array | Linked List |
	|:-----:|:-----------:|
	| Size is fixed | Dynamic size |
	| Inserting new element is expensive | Ease of insertion / deletion |
	| Random access is allowed | Random access is not allowed |
	| Better cache locality which affects performance | Extra memory space for a pointer for each element of the list |

* **Complexity of binary search when array is not sorted.**  
Binary search is for sorted list. It does not work for unsorted list. For unsorted list, just do a straight search starting from the first element O(n). If not, use O(nlogn) sort then do binary search.

* **What is Code Coverage?**  
Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage.

	Basic Coverage Criteria
	* **Function coverage** - has each function in the program been called?
	* **Statement coverage** - has each statement in the program been executed?
	* **Branch coverage** - has each branch of each control structure been executed?
	* **Condition coverage** - has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?

* **What is buffer overflow.**  
A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended to hold.

* **What is first chance exception.**  
When an application is being debugged, the debugger gets notified whenever an exception is encountered. At this point, the application is suspended and the debugger decides how to handle the exception. The first pass through this mechanism is called a first chance exception. Depending on the debugger's configuration, it will either resume the application and pass the exception on or it will leave the application suspended and enter debug mode. If the application handles the exception, it continues to run normally.

* **What is RDBMS?**  
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of one or more database table fields.

* **Complexity of search algorithm in Linked List.**  
O(n)

* **Deadlock, explain.**  
Deadlock is a situation when two threads are waiting on each other to release a resource. Each thread waiting for a resource which is held by the other waiting thread.  
	Conditions for deadlock:
	* Mutual Exclusion.
	* Hold and Wait.
	* No preemptive.
	* Circular wait.

* **Complexity of linked list and tree insertion.**  
LinkedList - O(1)  
Tree - O(log(n))

* **Program that determines whether or not a number is prime?**  
IsPrime

* **Explain buble sort, insertion sort, merge sort.**  
	* **Bubble Sort**  
	Is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  
	* **Insertion Sort**  
	Is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
	* **Merge Sort**  
	Is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element and then repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.

* **Design a car parking lot.**  
ParkingLot

* **Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList**

	| ArrayList | LinkedList |
	|:---------:|:----------:|
	| Uses dynamic array | Uses doubly linked list |
	| Is not efficient for manipulation because of shifting | Efficient for manipulation |
	| Better to store and fetch data | Better to manipulate data |

* **Design a traffic signal using Java.**  
TrafficSignal

* **What is the difference between a Set and a List?**

	| Set | List |
	|:---:|:----:|
	| Does not allow duplicates | Allow duplicates |
	| Unordered collection | Ordered collection |
	| HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet | ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList |
	| Use when want unique elements | Use when want to maintain the order |

* **What is MVC?**  
Model View Controller (MVC) is a design pattern for successfully and efficiently relating the user interface to underlying data models.
	* **Model** - Represents the underlying, logical structure of data in a software application and the high level class associated with it. This object model does not contain any information about the user interface.
	* **View** - Collection of classes representing the elements in the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes, and so forth).
	* **Controller** - The class connecting the model and the view, and is used to communicate between classes in the model and view.

* **When and why to use recursion.**
	* Iterative functions are typically faster than their recursive counterparts. So, if speed is an issue, you would normally use iteration.
	* If the stack limit is too constraining then you will prefer iteration over recursion.
	* Some procedures are very naturally programmed recursively, and all but unmanageable iteratively.

* **Name and describe java design patterns.**  
Same as design pattern question.

* **Describe generics.**  
Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify with a single method declaration, a set of related methods or, with a single class declaration, a set of related types respectively.  
	Generics allow you to customize a "generic" method or class to whatever type you're working with.

* **Inner join VS outer join.**

	| Inner Join | Outer Join |
	|:----------:|:----------:|
	| Inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B; the inner part of a venn diagram | Outer join of A and B gives the result of A union B; the outer part of a venn diagram |

* **Program to convert number to binary.**  
NumberToBinary

* **Can interfaces be instantiated?**  
No. You can only implement an interface.

* **Abstract vs Interface**

	| Abstract | Interface |
	|:--------:|:---------:|
	| Contains at least one abstract method. | Can only contain only abstract methods. |
	| Can have `public`, `private`, `protected` or default variables and also constants. | Variable is by default `public final`. |
	| A class can extend only 1 abstract class | A class can implement multiple interfaces. |
	| Not compulsory to implement all methods when extended. | Compulsory to implement all methods when implemented. |
	| Can simply implement a new method. | If new implementation is added, all classes need to implement the interface. |

* **Private, protected, public.**

	| Modifier | Accessible in the same package | Accessible in different package |
	|:------------:|:-----:|:----------------------------:|
	|	Private		|	No	|	No	|
	|	Protected	|	Yes	|	Yes, only if the class extends the main class  |
	|	Default		|	Yes	|	No	|
	|	Public		|	Yes	|	Yes	|

* **What is path coverage?**  
Testing a program by examining which lines of executable codes are visited (as in code coverage testing) and also the ways of getting to each line of code and the subsequent sequence of execution.  
Path coverage testing is the most comprehensive type of testing that a test suite can provide. It can find more bugs, especially those that are caused by data coupling. However, path coverage is hard and usually only used for small and/or critical sections of code.

* **Various software testing levels and explain.**  
	* **Unit Testing**  
	Unit testing is a level of software testing process where individual units/components of a software/system are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
	* **Integration Testing**  
	Integration testing is a level of the software testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
	* **System Testing**  
	System testing is a level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/softawre is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the specified requirements.
	* **Acceptance Testing**  
	Acceptance testing is a level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

* **What is normalization and denormalization in database.**  
**Normalization**  
Is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy. Involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using defined foreign keys.

	**Denormalization**  
	Is the process of attempting to optimize the read performance of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data. Two methods; keep the logical design normalized, but allow the database management system (DBMS) to store additional redundant information on disk to optimize query response. Another method is to denormalize the logical data design.

* **Find a number using binary search algorithm.**  
Algorithms -> BinarySearch

* **DBMS VS RDBMS.**  

	| DBMS | RDBMS |
	|:----:|:-----:|
	| Store data as files. | Store data in a tabular form. |
	| There can be, but there will be no relation between tables. | There is relation between tables. |
	| Data is generally stored in either hierarchical form or navigational form; a single data unit will have one parent node and zero, one or more children nodes. | The tables will have primary key. Data values will be stored in the form of tables as well as the relationships between these data values. |
	| Harder to access data. | Easier to access and find data. |
	| Data fetching is slower for complex and large amount of data | Comparatively faster because ot is relational model. |
	| Easier to construct but less secure. Data not stored according to ACID model which may introduce inconsistencies in the database. | Harder to construct but more secure. They follow the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolcation and durability) model when storing data. |  
	| Data redundancy is common in this model | Keys and indexes are used in the tables to avoid redundancy |
	| Used for applications using small amount of data | Used for complex and large amount of data |
	| Examples : dBase, Microsoft Access, LibreOffice Base, FoxPro. | Examples : SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, SQLite |

* **What is database normalization and forms of it.**  
Database normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is used for mainly two purpose:
	* Eliminating redundant (useless) data.
	* Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.
	
	Forms of normalization:
	1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**  
	No two rows of data must contain repeating group of information i.e each set of column must have a unique value, such that multiple columns cannot be used to fetch the same row. Each table should be organized into rows, and each row should have a primary key that distinguishes it as unique.
	2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**  
	There must not be any partial dependency of any column on primary key. It means that for a table that has concatenated primary key, each column in the table is not part of the primary key must depend upon the entire concatenated key for its existence. If any column depends only on one part of the concatenated key, then the table fails Second Normal Form.
	3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
	Every non-prime attribute of table must be dependent on primary key, or we can say that, there should not be the case that a non-prime attribute is determined by another non-prime attribute. So this transitive functional dependency should be removed from the table and also the table must be in Second Normal Form.  
	Advantage of removing transitive dependency is :
		* Amount of data duplication is reduced.
		* Data integrity achieved.
	4. **Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**  
	Higher version of the Third Normal Form. This form deals with certain type of anamoly that is not handled by 3NF. A 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys is said to be in BCNF. Following conditions must be satisfied :
		* R must be in 3rd Normal Form.
		* For each functional dependency (X -> Y), X should be a super key.
		
* **Concept of 1 to many relationships in databases with an example.**  
A 1 to many relationship occurs when a parent record in one table can potentially reference several child records in another table. It allows 0 child records, a single child records or multiple child records. the important thing is that the child cannot have more than one parent record.  
	Example:  
	* CUSTOMER table : used for storing customer master details. Primary key is CUST_ID.
	* SALES table : used for keeping track of individual sales transactions.  
	The SALES table contains CUST_ID foreign key, which references the column of the same name in the CUSTOMER table to track the customer to whom the sale was made. A single sales transaction can only apply to one customer, but one customer can have many sales transaction over the course of time.
	
* **There is a class Car and a class Paint. What is the relationship between them and explain.**  
	* **Car and Paint is a "Has a" relationship (Composition)**  
	Each car is composed by tires, engine etc. It also has a Paint. It has sublcasses such as red, blue etc. It means that this car can have a color.  
	* **Advantages to separate Paint from Car**  
	If the car is simple it can only have a string color to represent the color of the car. But with separation, you can do more things:
		* Paint can hold new color information  
		You can just create a new color which inherits from Paint class.
		* Paint can hold more colors
		Paint class can have more information. Ex: The 4 tires color are different, the car roof color is different. So you can specify the colors very easy.

* **What is relative database?**  
A relational database is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational model of data. This model organizes data into one or more tables of rows and columns, with a unique key for each row.

* **Recursive VS Iterative algorithm.**  

	Both of the algorithm perform the same kind of tasks which is to solve a complicated task one piece at a time, and combine the results.

	| Recursive | Iterative |
	|:---------:|:---------:|
	| Is a function that is partially defined by itself and consists of some simple case with a known answer. | Are loop based imperative repetitions of a process. |
	| Solve a large problem by breaking it up into smaller pieces until you can solve it, combine the results. | Keep repeating until a task is done. |
	| Good recursive solutions may be more difficult to design and test. | Sometimes might be easier to understand and faster |
	
* **Design an unbalanced BST using the word "CERNER", duplicates allowed.**  
BinarySearchTree -> WordBST

* **Write a program to find max number read input from user and return max number.**  
MaxNumberFromInputs

* **Tell me something that you really like about Java and something that you really dislike.**  
	Like  
	* Garbage collection.
	* Javadoc.
	* Usability (being able to go from platform to platform without changing code)
	* Code completion.
	
	Dislike  
	* No memory management.
	* JVM overhead.
	
* **Which was my favorite IDE, debugging tool.**  
Java - Eclipse & Eclipse Debugging Tool.  
Web - SubmlimeText, FireBug.  
Mobile - Xcode.

* **What are pointers, how are they used, what is a wild pointer.**  
A variable whose value is the address of another variable (direct address of the memory location). It is used by storing memory addresses, usually the addresses of other variables.  
Dangling pointer and wild pointer are pointers that do not point to a valid object of the appropriate type.  
Example: if you delete an object from memory explicitly or by destroying the stack frame on return does not alter associated pointers. They still point to the same location in memory even though the reference has since been deleted and may now be used for other purposes.

* **How to create unit test cases?**  
	* **Define the test cases.**  
	Normal case, the extremes, nulls and illegal inputs, strange inputs.
	* **Define the expected results.**  
	Make sure that the results are correct.
	* **Set up all conditions for testing.**  
	Set up the data required by the method. The unit test should always create their own test data to execute against. That way, we can be confident that our tests aren't dependent upon the state of a particular environment and will be repeatable even if they are executed in a different environment from which they were written.
	* **Call the method (or Trigger) being tested.**  
	Call the method directly.
	* **Verify that the results are correct.**  
	You want to make sure that the results are correct. Good way to verify results is to look for liberal use of the System.assert() methods.
	* **Clean up modified records.**  
	Actions performed on records inside a unit test are not committed to the database. This means that we can insert, delete, and modify records without having to write any code that will clean up our changes.  
  
	* **Testing Normal Conditions**  
	* **Testing Unexpected Conditions**
		* Bad Input Values
		* Boundary Conditions
		
	Properties of Well-Written Unit Tests
	* **Thorough**  
	Unit test should exercise the expected as well as the unexpected conditions in your code. Special attention should be paid to areas of code that are particularly likely to break.
	* **Repeatable**  
	Every one of your unit tests should be able to be run repeatedly and continue to produce the same results, regardless of the environment in which the tests are being run.
	* **Independent**  
	Your unit tests should only test one aspect of your code at a time, so that it is easy to understand the purpose of each unit test.
	
* **If you had to determine whether a padlock was functioning properly with only 3 tests, what tests would you use?**  
	* Who will use it? And why?
	* What are the use cases?
	* What are the bounds of use?
	* What are the stress/failure conditions?
	* How would you perform the testing?

* **Unit test a function which uses the following parameters: reverseString(originalString, stringToBeReversed, stringReverseTo, max) (Come up with as many test cases as possible).**  
	* What happens if the string is null.
	* String with only one character.
	* String with only one space.
	* String with combination of uppercase and lowercase.
	* String with only special characters.
	* String with alphanumeric.
	* String with multiple spaces in between words.
	* What if the string has same characters.
	* What if the string is a palindrome.
	* What is the longest length of the string function can accept.
	* Can this reverse integers?
	* If it fails due to some reason how does it cope up?
	* What if the end of string is not terminated by null character?
	* What if string contains space in the middle or special characters.
	* What if the string contains extra spaces at the end.
	* String with spaces at starting. Single and multiple.
	
* **How would you go about debugging your code if a client brought up issues with the program.**  
	* Replicate the problem described by the client.
	* Check the log file to see where the code breaks.
	* Run the program again with breakpoints where it breaks.
	* Run in debug mode and step into the codes to check the values where is unexpected.

* **Explain insertion/deletion and traversal in BST.**  
	* **Insertion**  
	Compare the values each time going down the tree. If tree is empty create a new root.
	* **Deletion**  
		* Case 1 : Leaf nodes.  
		Remove the node.
		* Case 2 : Node with one child.  
		Replace the node with the child node and remove the node.
		* Case 3 : Node with two children.  
		Find the smallest node in the right subtree and replace it with the node. Then, the child of the smallest node takes it place.
	* **Traversal**  
		* In Order : left, root, right.
		* Pre Order : root, left subtree, right subtree.
		* Post Order : left subtree, right subtree, root.

* **What is buffer overflow?**  
Buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to an adjacent memory buffer after overrunning the memory allocated to it. This leads to a serious impact with respect to buffer safety. This could lead to crash. memory over flows and erratic behavior and can be prevented using bounds checking, pointer protection etc.

* **What is memory leaks?**  
A memory leak is a condition when a program that has occupied computer's memory is unable to release it back to the operating system. Memory leaks are detected when the OS throws "Out of memory" exception, or when it becomes sluggish and slow. It can also be monitored by checking the memory status in the task bar.

* **If there was anything you wanted to change about a programming language, what would it be?**  
The combination of managed and non managed memory so you can use both depending on the situation.

* **How do you handle garbage collecting?**  
When no references to an object exist, the object is assumed to be no longer needed, and the memory occupied by the object can be reclaimed.  
	**Using the finalize() method**  
	Sometimes an object will need to perform some action when it is destroyed. For example, if an object is holding some non-Java resource such as a file handle or window character font, then you might want to make sure these resources are freed before an object is destroyed. To handle such situations, Java provides a mechanism called finalization. By using finalization, you can define specific actions that will occur when an object is just about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. 
To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the finalize( ) method. The Java run time calls that method whenever it is about to recycle an object of that class. Inside the finalize( ) method you will specify those actions that must be performed before an object is destroyed. The garbage collector runs periodically, checking for objects that are no longer referenced by any running state or indirectly through other referenced objects. Right before an asset is freed, the Java run time calls the finalize() method on the object.

* **Explain a time when you used polymorphism.**  
	Poly - many  
	Morph - change of form  
	Is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlaying forms (data types).  
	Created MountainBike and RoadBike classes which both extend Bicycle and they both override the printDescription method.

* **Explain a time when you used inheritance.**  
OS project where each cases extends the case base class and implemented their own run method.

* **Software life cycle and software testing.**  
	* **Software Life Cycle**  
		* Requirement gathering and analysis.
		* Design.
		* Implentation or coding.
		* Testing.
		* Deployment.
		* Maintenance.  
	Software Testing (See question on software testing)

* **What is the difference between inheritance and encapsulation.**  

	| Inheritance | Encapsulation |
	|:-----------:|:-------------:|
	| Allows a class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class | Allows an object to only reveal the interfaces needed to interact with it |
	|

* **Name and explain the various design patterns.**  
Three basic kinds of design patterns:
	* **Structural**  
	Is all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
		* Adapter - match interfaces of different classes.
		* Bridge - separates an object's interface from its implementation.
		* Composite - a tree structure of simple and composite objects.
		* Decorator - add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
		* Facade - a single class that represents an entire subsystem.
		* Flyweight - a fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
		* Private Class Data - restricts accessor/mutator access.
		* Proxy - an object representing another object.
	* **Creational**  
	Is all about class instantiation.
		* Abstract Factory - creates an instance of several families of classes.
		* Builder - separates object construction from its representation.
		* Factory Method - creates an instance of several derived classes.
		* Object Pool - avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use.
		* Prototype - a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
		* Singleton - a class of which only a single instance can exist.
	* **Behavioral**  
	Is all about Class's objects communication. Communication between objects.
		* Chain of responsibility - a way of passing a request between chain of objects.
		* Command - encapsulates a command request as an object.
		* Interpreter - a way to include language elements in a program.
		* Iterator - sequentially access the elements of a collection.
		* Mediator - defines simplified communication between classes.
		* Memento - capture and restore an object's internal state.
		* Null Object - designed to act as a default value of an object.
		* Observer - a way of notifying change to a number of classes.
		* State - alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
		* Strategy - encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
		* Template method - defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.
		* Visitor - defines a new operation to a class without change.

* **How was MVVM design pattern used in my project.**  
	Components of MVVM:
	* **Model**  
	Refers either to a domain model, which represents the real state content or the data access layer that represents that content.
	* **View**  
	The view is what the users see or the user interface.
	* **View Model**  
	An abstraction of the view that exposes public properties and commands. Instead of the controller of the MVC pattern, MVVM has a binder. In the view model, this binder mediates communication between the view and the data binder.  
	* **Binder**  
	Declarative data and command binding are implicit in the MVVM pattern. The binder frees the developer from being obliged to write boiler-plate logic to synchronise the view model and view.

* **Describe the most difficult software bug you ever encountered in software you were developing, how you approached it, and how you resolved it.**

* **Design a class which stores demographic information of a person like name, address, phone number, male/female. What if the person has any prefix to the name, multiple phone numbers/addresses, how will you handle dob in case of multiple locations (if a person is both at 12pm in USA on a date, then that date is different from date in India), how will you handle validations of these fields when the user enters the values.**  
Demographic

* **What is your favorite data structure?**  
Hashtable and Binary Tree.

* **What is the difference between a thread and a process?**  
	* Threads are easier to create than processes since they don't require a separate address space.
	* Multithreading requires careful programming since threads share data structures that should only be modified by one thread at a time. Unlike threads, processes don't share the same address space.
	* Threads are considered lightweight because they use far less resources than processes.
	* Processes are independent of each other. Threads, since they share the same address space are interdependent, so caution must be taken so that different threads don't step on each other.
	* A process consists of multiple threads.

* **Difference between memory managed and non-memory managed languages.**

	| Memory Managed | Non-memory Managed |
	|:--------------:|:------------------:|
	| Garbage collection | No garbage collection |
	| Run-time type checking | No run-time type checking |
	| Cannot be accessed outside the runtime environment | Compiles straight to machine code and directly executed by the OS |
	| Platform independent | Platform dependent |

* **What are memory managed languages, name them.**  
Java, JavaScript, C#.

* **What is a race condition?**  
A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.

* **Explain DNS server.**
Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This is necessary because, although domain names are easy for people to remember, computers or machines, access websites based on IP addresses.
