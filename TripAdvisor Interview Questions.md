* **NP complete problem.**

* **What is the difference between array and linked list.**

* **What if you had the worst hash function ever. What is the complexity of lookup?**

* **How many dates in the 1900's in the form mm/DD/yy are palindromes?**

* **How can you tell efficiently how many consecutive zero's are in a number without looping through its digits.**

* **When is balanced tree is better than hashtable?**  
	* When there are too many collisions in the hashtable.
	* When you need the items in a sorted order.
	
* **How would you implement a bit vector data structure? Optimizing for memory?**

* **What are properties of a good hash?**  
	* The hash value is fully determined by the data being hashed.
	* The hash function uses all the input data.
	* The hash function "uniformly" distributes the data across the entire set of possible hash values.
	* The hash function generates very different hash values for similar things.
